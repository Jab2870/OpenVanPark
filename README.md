# Open Van Park

(Naming stuff is hard)

This is the very early stages of a repository of places you can park vans. Think
something like park4night, but open source and open data.

I plan on making a hugo site for this eventually (hence the hugo skeleton), but
for now, I want to start with collecting data. If you have places you can park
in a van, please consider submitting them.

## Privacy

Note that submissions will be tied to your github account. If you submit a bunch
of locations around your house, it may be possible to work out the area in which
you live.
